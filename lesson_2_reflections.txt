What happens when you intialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When you intialize a repository you create a .git folder that will begin
to create a version log when you use the git commit function. You need to 
do it so that git will know you want to begin using git version control on
this directory.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have on commit per logical change?

You can use the staging area to ensure that you have one commit per logical change by
limitting how many files you commit to at a time. For example if you have a project with 
two files.... index.html and script.js and you make one change to each file. Instead of 
committing them both at the same time you could add just one file to the staging area, commit
that one and add a useful commit message to it and then do the same for the second file in 
a different commit.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history oranized?
How would branches help?

Branches are helpful for when multiple people are working on the same project. Two or more people
could be working on the same project at the same time but on different branches. Branches could
also be used to fork projects that go in a completely different direction from what the project author
orginally intended. You could do that by never megering the branches.
