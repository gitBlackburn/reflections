When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

-When you want to collaborate with others. 
-When you want access to your data from more than one location.
-When you want others to take a look at what you are working on.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date
with your remote repository?

-Maybe you might want to test out features locally before making them publically available.
