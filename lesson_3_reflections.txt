When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

-When you want to collaborate with others. 
-When you want access to your data from more than one location.
-When you want others to take a look at what you are working on.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date
with your remote repository?

-Maybe you might want to test out features locally before making them publically available.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

-Clones, make copies of all current files in a given directory along with their histories. 
-Forks are similar to clones but they are hosted directly on gitHub.
-Branches diverge from the main branches of a project. They can be useful for testing out new features that
might not yet be ready for the main live project.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

-Maybe the main reason why it is a benefit is so that you can access the local version of the remote 
when you are somewhere you cannot get access to the internet.
